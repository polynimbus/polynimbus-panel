## Overview

Polynimbus Panel is a subproject of Polynimbus, multi-cloud infrastructure inventory
and management tool. Panel subproject provides a clean and simple web panel, showing
all servers, databases, storage, domains, serverless objects etc., created across all
cloud accounts configured in Polynimbus.

Using this panel, you can avoid over 90% of switching your browser between accounts
during typical DevOps/SRE work and dramatically increase your productivity.

#### Polynimbus supports the following services and functionalities:

## Security model

Configuring administrative access to many cloud accounts on a single host (either
running Polynimbus or not) makes it very sensitive to any kind of inappropriate
activities (also internal).

Polynimbus Panel doesn't require any cloud access credentials, and operates only
on files generated by Polynimbus Inventory. Therefore it is provided as a separate
repository, to allow installing on a separate host - in such scenario, the whole
`/var/cache/polynimbus` directory should be rsynced, and host running core Polynimbus
shouldn't expose any other services than ssh.


## Installation

Polynimbus Panel is compatible with any webserver with PHP 5.2 or later. It doesn't
require any database access, unusual extensions, or write access to anything. It is
actively developed and tested using Apache2 with Debian-style configuration, but it
should work everywhere, probably even on Windows.

Manual installation:
- installing classic Apache2/PHP, or Nginx/PHP stack
- setting up a new vhost, or just symlinking `public` subdirectory somewhere inside existing vhost
- setting up proper security measures (eg. password protection) to prevent sharing sensitive data with anyone

#### Basic vhost configuration for Apache2

This is the simplest possible vhost configuration, with **no security at all**:
- no password protection
- no IP protection
- no SSL
- no server hardening
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName polynimbus.yournet.internal
    DocumentRoot /var/www/polynimbus-panel/public
    <Directory /var/www/polynimbus-panel/public>
        Options FollowSymLinks
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```
